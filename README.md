# NCViewer

## Goal 
## Motivation 
## Methods 

global.R   
- to see if the script is working properly    

ncviewer.R 
- a script for shiny apps    

cidp_edx.R 
- output file: for each ncs parameters, the number of nerves that meet edx criteria for CIDP 2010 EFNS/PNS    
- any difference in the pattern of edx demyelinating features between CIDP and non-CIDP that meet EDX criteria for CIDP?    
- did not exclude median nerve CTS for DML (should have)
- did not exclude ulnar nerve across the elbow segment for CB (should have)  
- did not consider probable conduction block (only definite)   
- if probable CB is considered, then posterior tibial nerve should not be counted    
- did not exclude the wrist and Erb's point segment for definite partial conduction block (there should be no definite partial conduction block in this segment, only probable conduction block with 50% reduction criteria)  


input data should take a wide format  
- Hosp, Date, Name, ID, Sex, Age
- 112 NCS parameters (values should be expressed as percentage values relative upper or lower limit of normal as appropriate)
